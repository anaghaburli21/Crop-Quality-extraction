## Overview

The Automated Crop Quality Assessment project leverages computer vision techniques to evaluate the quality of agricultural produce. By analyzing images of crops, the system can classify them based on predefined quality standards such as ripeness, presence of defects, and color uniformity. This solution aims to assist farmers, retailers, and quality control professionals by providing a fast, objective, and scalable approach to grading crops.

## Objectives

- To develop a machine learning model that can analyze crop images and determine their quality.
- To minimize human subjectivity and labor costs in the crop grading process.
- To provide visual and textual feedback on crop quality.
- To implement the model in a user-friendly interface for practical use.

## Technologies Used

- Python – Core programming language
- OpenCV – For image preprocessing and enhancement
- TensorFlow / PyTorch – For building deep learning models
- CNN (Convolutional Neural Networks) – For image classification tasks
- Flask / Streamlit – For developing the web interface
- Google Colab / Jupyter Notebook – For training and testing models
- Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib – Data handling and visualization

## Dataset

- Images of crops like tomatoes, apples, or potatoes labeled with quality grades (e.g., good, average, poor).
- Source: Kaggle, self-collected data, or agricultural open datasets.
- Image classes include healthy crops, overripe/underripe produce, and produce with defects such as bruises, rot, or discoloration.

## How It Works

1. Image Input: Upload a crop image through the interface.
2. Preprocessing: Image is resized, normalized, and augmented.
3. Prediction: The model classifies the crop into quality categories using trained CNNs.
4. Output: Displays the quality category with probability/confidence and possible reasons (if included in model logic).
5. Visualization: Bounding boxes or heatmaps can be optionally shown to highlight defect regions.

## Results

- Achieved an accuracy of approximately 92% on validation data.
- Model is capable of detecting visible defects and categorizing ripeness levels.
- Works well under standard lighting and image clarity conditions.
